                    If during the warranty period you submit a claim for
                    warranty service in accordance with this Limited Warranty,

                    using new parts or previously used parts that satisfy
                    Garmin’s quality standards, (ii) replace the Product with a
                    new Product or a refurbished Product that meets Garmin’s
                    quality standards, or (iii) exchange the Product for a full
                    refund of your purchase price. SUCH REMEDY SHALL BE YOUR
                    SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF WARRANTY.
                    Repaired or replaced Product has a 90 day warranty. If the
                    Product sent in is still under its original warranty, then
                    the new warranty is 90 days or to the end of the original 1
                    year warranty, whichever is longer.

                    This Limited Warranty is effective in the original country
                    of purchase. If you seek warranty service outside of the
                    original country of purchase, Garmin cannot guarantee that
                    the parts and products needed to repair or replace your
                    product will be available due to differences in product
                    offerings and applicable standards, laws and regulations. In
                    that case, Garmin may, in its sole discretion and subject to
                    applicable laws, repair or replace your product with
                    comparable Garmin products and parts, or require you to ship
                    your product to a Garmin Authorized facility in the country
                    of original purchase or to a Garmin Authorized facility in
                    another country that can service your product, in which case
                    you will be responsible for complying with all applicable
                    import and export laws and regulations and for paying all
                    custom duties, V.A.T. or any taxes on goods or services,
                    shipping fees and other associated taxes and charges. In
                    some cases, Garmin and its dealers may be unable to service
                    your product in a country outside of the original country of
                    purchase or return a repaired or replaced Product to you in
                    that country due to applicable standards, laws or
                    regulations in that country.

                    by international distributors for devices purchased outside
                    Singapore depending on the country. If applicable, this
                    warranty is provided by the local in-country distributor and
                    this distributor provides local service for your device.
                    Distributor warranties are only valid in the area of
