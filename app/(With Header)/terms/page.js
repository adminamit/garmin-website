                    1.4 Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before
                    ordering from the Site. By ordering any products from the

                    Conditions from time to time without prior notice by
                    changing them on the Site, provided that any such change
                    will not affect any purchases you have made before the
                    change is implemented.

                <h2 id="2ordering">2. Ordering</h2>
                <p>
                    2.1 You may place an order to purchase a product advertised
                    for sale on the Site by following the onscreen prompts after
                    clicking on the product you are interested in. You will have
                    an opportunity to check and correct any input errors in your
                    order up until the point at which you submit your order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.2 After submitting an order to us, you will be sent an
                    order acknowledgement email. Please note, this email is an
                    acknowledgement and is not an acceptance of your order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.3 Acceptance of your order and the formation of a contract
                    between us will take place when we send you an email
                    confirming that the products you have ordered are being
                    shipped to you, unless we have notified you that we do not
                    accept your order or you have already cancelled it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.4 You can check the status of an outstanding order at any
                    time by locating the relevant order after logging into the
                    ‘Your Account’ section of the Site, using the username and
                    password which you will have been asked to create to become

                <h2 id="3pricesandpayment">3. Prices and Payment</h2>
                <p>
                    3.1 The price of the products will be as quoted on our Site
                    from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Product
                    prices include VAT at the prevailing rate. The price quoted
                    on our Site exclude delivery charges which are quoted
                    separately on our Site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.2 Prices may change at any time prior to (but not after)
                    acceptance of your order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.3 We cannot accept your order until you have paid for it
                    in full. Payment can be made by most major credit or debit
                    cards by completing the relevant details on the checkout
                    page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.4 Our Site contains a large number of products and it is
                    always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the
                    products listed on our Site may be incorrectly priced. We
                    will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch
                    procedures so that, where a product{"'"}s correct price is
                    less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount
                    when dispatching the product to you. If a product{"'"}s
                    correct price is higher than the price stated on our
                    website, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact
                    you for instructions before dispatching the product, or
                    reject your order and notify you that we are rejecting it.
                    If the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could
                    have reasonably been recognised by you as an error, we do
                    not have to provide the products to you at the incorrect
                    (lower) price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.5 By using a credit/debit card to pay for your order, you
                    warrant and confirm that the card being used is yours or, if
                    not yours, you are authorized to use such card. All
                    credit/debit card transactions are subject to validation
                    checks and authorization by the card issuer. If the issuer
                    of your card refuses to authorize payment we will not accept
                    your order, we will not be obliged to inform you of the
                    reason for the refusal, and we will not be liable for
                    non-delivery. We are not responsible for your card issuer or
                    bank charging you as a result of our processing of your
                    credit/debit card payment in accordance with your order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.6 We recommend that you do not communicate your payment
                    card details to anyone, including us, by email or chat. We
                    cannot be responsible for any losses you may incur in
                    transmitting information to us by internet link, or email or
                    chat. Any such loss will be entirely your responsibility.
                </p>

                    Store (e.g. Apple App Store and Google Play Store). The data
                    connection between the users’ device and the data server

                    Any data exchange to download or use digital products,
                    services or applications via the internet may result in
                    additional costs, depending on the users’ respective mobile
                    phone and internet provider plan, especially when operating
                    abroad (e.g. roaming charges). For information on mobile
                    phone and internet plan terms and conditions, users have to
                    contact their mobile carrier or internet provider.

                    NOTICE: Due to international and national shipping
                    regulations, accessory batteries cannot ship via air. Please
                    be advised that your selected shipping method may be changed

                    impacted.

                rights. To return a product purchased from the Site, please send
                your intent to return or cancel to us anytime prior to the date
                30 days after the date you, or a person indicated by you,

                product with the original receipt, original packaging and its
                included accessories to us. You have a further 14 days after
                indicating your intent to return or cancel a service contract to
                then return your products. You will have to bear the direct cost
                of returning these goods. You may be liable if the value of the
                goods returned diminishes due to the handling of the goods
                (except when it was necessary to establish the nature,

                expensive type of delivery offered by us, no later than 14 days
                from the day on which we received the above communication. We
                will use the same means of payment as you used for the initial
                transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise. In any
                event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such
                reimbursement. We may withhold reimbursement until we have
                received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having
                sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest.
